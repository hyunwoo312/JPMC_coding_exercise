## JPMC Coding Exercise

### main
* Added @param / @return documentations
* Added final keywords to variable when possible
* Improved Singleton implementation for LocalDateProvider class
* Moved functions & stored variables to appropriate classes
* Added GSON dependency to handle JSON formatting

### test
* CustomerTests and MovieTests were NOT added as they did not feel necessary given the current design
* Did NOT add test cases for every scenario as it looked overkill for this exercise. Only added a couple just to verify the minimal functionality.
